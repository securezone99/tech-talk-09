1. Update my FastAPI project to use Docling (CPU) for PDF processing, in addition to Markdown. Update my requirement txt with "docling" and try to install it

2. Regarding the dependencies in my requirements.txt, search the internet and ensure that I pin each one to a fixed, up-to-date version. After updating, try running the project again to see if it still works.

3. Create a Dockerfile for my project.
